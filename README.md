# SimpleBoilLogic
Boil logic for craftbeerpi

Simple logic to set the heater power setting during the ramp up period and then have it scaled back to a boiling power setting.

For example 100% ramp up power would be used until the target of say 98Â°C is reached after which the heater power would be reduced to the desired setting for a rolling boil ie 70%.
